/*
Task: Create an application that simulates dice rolling.
What will the application do?
* Ask the user to enter the number of sides for a pair of dice.
* Prompt the user to roll the dice.
* “Roll” two n-sided dice, display the results of each, and then ask the user if
he/she wants to roll the dice again.

Build Specifications
1. Define a static method named generateRandomDieRoll. It has a parameter that
specifies the number of sides on a die and returns a random number between 1
and that number. Call this method for each die that is rolled.
2. Experiment with different Random number generators–start with the random()
method of the Math class but also explore Java’s Random class.

	Instructions, y/n
		instructions: 
		This will be a simple game of street dice, not craps. The basic rules are the same, but craps allows you to bet against yourself, 
		allows others to bet, and allows side bets throughout the game.
		According to casino.org, it's bad luck to say "seven" at a craps table, but you can refer to them as "jerks", since rolling a seven
		will lose you the game (unless it's your first roll (the "come-out roll"), which actually wins you the game!
		Step 1: Bet some money; it's tough to learn without some skin in the game.
		Step 2: Roll the dice. If it's a 7 or 11, you win right away; if it's a 2, 3, or 12, you lose.
		Step 3: If you rolled any other number (not 7, 11, 2, 3, or 12) then this number becomes "The Point". You're goal now (since you weren't
		lucky enough to roll a 7 or 11) is to roll The Point again, before rolling a 7 or 11. If you roll the point again, you win; if you roll a 7 or 11, you lose.
		Good Luck! Press enter to roll the Come-Out.
