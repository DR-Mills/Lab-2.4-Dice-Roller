/*
Task: Create an application that simulates dice rolling.
What will the application do?
* Ask the user to enter the number of sides for a pair of dice.
* Prompt the user to roll the dice.
* “Roll” two n-sided dice, display the results of each, and then ask the user if
he/she wants to roll the dice again.

Build Specifications
1. Define a static method named generateRandomDieRoll. It has a parameter that
specifies the number of sides on a die and returns a random number between 1
and that number. Call this method for each die that is rolled.
2. Experiment with different Random number generators–start with the random()
method of the Math class but also explore Java’s Random class.
